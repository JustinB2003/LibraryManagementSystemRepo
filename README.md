Java
The Library Management System provides a straightforward interface for managing library resources and member transactions

Employees working in the library can interact with the system through a console menu. It comprises classes for books, members, and the library itself, they can add books and members, search for books by title or author, and perform book checkout and return operations. The main class handles user input and displays a menu, prompting the employees to choose from various options. It communicates with the library class to execute the selected actions, such as adding books/members, finding books, or managing book borrowing/returning. Exception handling ensures smooth operation by catching errors like invalid email formats or missing books/members.
